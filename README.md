👩‍💻 I'm currently working on [Oofnote](https://oofnote.vercel.app/).

🧠 I'm currently learning Java and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that use React or anything with js/ts.

🤔 I'm looking for help with my life _(jk, maybe?)_

💬 Ask me about javascript, ts, cpp, IDK what else. Just ask me, and I might be of some help.
