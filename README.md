👩‍💻 I'm currently working on [PHEW](https://phew.vercel.app).

🧠 I'm currently learning C++ and [Remix](https://remix.run).

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that use React or anything with js/ts.

🤔 I'm looking for help with my life *(jk, maybe?)*

💬 Ask me about javascript, ts, cpp, IDK what else.
